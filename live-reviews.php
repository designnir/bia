				<p>Yes, I am a nervous flier, but our Pilot (can't remember his name, sorry) made me feel safe and reassured. Each time we were about to hit bumpy air, he warned us ahead of time and told us exactly how long (not very) it would last. I would say at least 95% of the time, it was a very smooth flight. For the little bit that it wasn't, our Pilot made us feel safe and at ease.</p>
<p>Each person has a window seat in a very comfortable chair. We all wore headsets for the noise, as well as to hear the Pilot's narration about the sights and his amusing commentaries and stories. </p>
<p>Even though there was cloud cover, for most of the trip we stayed below the clouds, so we still had great views of the island. Toward the end of our flight, around sunset, we went above the clouds to see the beautiful colors of sunset.</p>	
<p>Our pilot was good about circling around at some of the more interesting sights so that both sides of the plane would get good views. Apparently we got very, very lucky and saw some great views of magma glowing red - one reason to take the sunset flight.
This was a beautiful way to see the island. Again, I want to thank our Pilot for a wonderful experience.</p>

				<p>We took an 11:30am Circle Tour flight today and it was spectacular!! Daryl was a wonderful pilot and he was able to fly us over the caldera where we saw the bubbling bright orange/red lava!! We were very fortunate that the weather cooperated and we had the opportunity!! Certainly a highlight for our trip to the Big Island! I highly recommend this tour!</p>
<p>As an additional note, we brought our 87 year old Mom who was able to climb the few stairs into the plane with our assistance. She can't walk far and we wheeled her out to the plane in her wheelchair. Wonderful that she could participate and have the experience as well with her daughters!</p>

				<p>We booked Big Island Air at the last minute after Sunshine Helicopters cancelled out on us. Sunshine claimed they had to cancel because the weather was bad, but after checking with other helicopter companies, we found out that this was not the case, and since other helicopter companies were fully-booked, we found Big Island Air by accident. It was a good thing we did because our flight was the most enjoyable part of our trip, and it was also less expensive than the helicopter tours. The staff was very accommodating when I called. The plane we rode was one of those single propeller ones (not a helicopter) and it was based in the commuter part of the Kona airport. We booked the Sunset tour which was the only one available. Our pilot Daryl was very knowlegeable and took us over lava falling into the ocean, as well as over the city of Hilo, Waipio Valley and the numerous waterfalls. He gave us a thorough safety orientation before the flight and his enthusiasm was contagious. I was able to take a lot of pictures and videos. I would highly recommend this company.</p>

				<p>This was probably the highlight of our Honeymoon. We took the VIP Air Adventure on Sept 29, 2016, it was alittle pricey but well worth it. I am a bit scared of small planes and turbulence but the pilot (who was also the tour guide), made me feel at ease and kept the turbulence to a minimal. He was funny and very ​knowledgeable. I felt very comfortable and safe throughout the plane ride. We saw such beautiful landscapes including amazing waterfalls and up the coast, beautiful beaches. He took us to the active volcano and over the lava that was flowing into the ocean. We also had the chance to fly over the volcano and see a lake of lava which was the most amazing thing I ever saw. He stayed over it for a quite a while. Definitely a once in a life time ​​experience and something I always wanted to see in person. Breathtaking and would recommend it to anyone!!!</p>

				<p>We did the sunset. Went around the entire island. The waterfalls... Hundreds.. Was spectacular. Volcano was nice. Cauldron had no fly zone as it is very active but got to see lava flowing and entering ocean. Second time we did this tour. First in 2008. Cheapest to book through their website I found</p>

				<p>This is the only way to see the island. Darryl our pilot was great! Don't hesitate in booking this tour it is well worth the money. We saw some fabulous views of the volcano and lava flow to the water along with wonderful views of the waterfalls in hidden valley. I will say it again -- this is the only way to see the island. A fantastic flight. Applause to Big Island Air.</p>
